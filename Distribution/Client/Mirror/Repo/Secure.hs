-- | Finalize the mirror (copy over index and TUF files)
--
-- We copy everything to temporary files in the destination directory first;
-- only when all files have been successfully copied we move them to their final
-- location. This is especially important if the target directory is mounted on,
-- say, an @sshfs@ file system, where the initial copy can be slow. We want to
-- avoid that these files are out of sync with each other for longer than
-- necessary. (In particular, it is important that these files are never out of
-- sync for longer than it takes a client to cycle through a few
-- check-for-update attempts before giving up.)
--
-- This happens _after_ all packages have been copied over, which poses no
-- problems: as long as the index is not updated, these additional packages are
-- not visible to clients.
--
-- Then we copy over the index before the TUF files; in principle, clients who
-- do an incremental update will not be affected by this (but new clients will
-- be, of course). The relative order of updating the @.tar@ versus the
-- @.tar.gz@ is unimportant: clients will never request both.
--
-- Then we update the TUF files in the opposite order that the client needs
-- them: mirrors, root, snapshot, and timestamp. This minimizes how many clients
-- will see an inconsistent state, although it does not eliminate the problem
-- altogether. (For instance, if we update the snapshot before the timestamp, a
-- client downloading the timestamp will see the old timestamp, conclude there
-- are no chances, and never see the modified snapshot.) However, even if we did
-- (by putting all these files in a directory, say, and symlinking the
-- directory) clients could _still_ see an inconsistent state because they
-- request these files one by one. If we really wanted to fix this, we'd have to
-- start versioning files on the server as described in the TUF spec; however,
-- since this is only applies to a few files, and clients will simply retry when
-- they get a verification error, it's not a priority.
